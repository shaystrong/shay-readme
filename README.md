# Working with Shay 

I was inspired to create this document based on what [Claire Hughes Johnson](https://assets.ctfassets.net/fzn2n1nzq965/6bKUeQ36CwyDoAUKC965tv/599e5b5a42bb970abbdba03c9ae87578/SCAPE_Working-With.pdf) had put together as the COO of Stripe. The purpose of this document is to share with you how I work and how you can best work with me. I look forward to having you as part of my team.

## Management Style

* I value transparency. I will be as direct as I can, although I will admit that I am a massive introvert and have to constantly be diligent in practicing direct feedback. I am a straightforward, authentic leader. I expect my leads to also be transparent and direct.
* As a scientist, I like facts and data. I dislike games or the manipulation of details.
* I like to think through things before speaking. 
* <i>Data or death.</i> Just kidding. But data is imperative for me to make decisions for the team or to help you with a problem or project. When you present ideas or information to me, be data-driven and quantitative if possible. Avoid qualitative assessements, especially when talking about engineering projects. I am a PhD scientist afterall.
* Collaboration and alignment is important. I do not try to make important decisions that impact our team in a black box. I will ask for your ideas and feedback. I may have an idea about an approach, but I will lean on my leadership team to bring points, facts, and data to our discussions to help inform the decision we make. If you do not bring ideas or feedback, I will make a decision with what data I have.
* I get excited about creative change especially if it will bring new opportunity, efficiency, or ideas. I moved my family sight-unseen to Finland from the US, for example. I will try to control myself when possible. Actions I take will always be intentional and I will think through the outcome.
* I will not be able to persist our culture alone. I have hired you as a leader to help me with this. Please proactively lean into transparent, intentional, data-driven, and inclusive dialogue with your teams.
* I trust you in the job for which you were hired. If I feel you or your team is lost or confused, I will step in to help or address this. It would be best for you to bring challenges to me before you get stuck here. I expect you to reach out with problems. I dislike being surprised by things we could have avoided earlier.
* I dislike having to chase people for things they said they would do. Please be proactive and own items that you indicated you would. Follow through.
* Vulnerability is everything. I am learning to be a better leader and contributor everyday. I do not know everything and I will ask questions. I expect you to do the same.
* I get anxious when I am late for meetings. I also see it as disrespectful to continuously be late for meetings. I will try to send you a note if it looks like I am going to be late. I will do my best to be on time.
* I care about you as a person (and your work-life balance). I enjoy hearing about your hobbies, families, and projects outside of work.
* I am a visual learner and communicator. I appreciate whiteboarding, graphics, and sketches.
* I highly value proactivity and a willingness to own things. Don't wait for me to task you.
* If I send a note on Slack, please acknowledge read-reciept with at least an emoji icon. Being hybrid + virtual + asychonrous can be lonely and unclear and I need to know you saw what I posted.

## Operating Approach

* <b>For direct reports:</b> I prefer weekly 1:1s. This meeting is to stategically align on important items, plans, and tasks. I want to chat about your general well-being and needs/blockers you have with your team(s). I am trying to get better about keeping notes/agenda doc attached to the meeting invite. I have not been so good in the past. Let's use a joint document to track topics and initiatives. This meeting is your meeting and I love for you to come with topics. Put them in the document. For mid-year and end-of-year reviews, we will have a separate shared document with objectives and expectations for the next 6 months. We can also revisit this quarterly.
   - For mid-year and end-of year discussions, we will chat about your career aspirations and ambitions (either in this org or elsewhere). We will brainstorm about specific personal goals you can accomplish in the next 6 months. 
* <b>If you are not my direct report:</b> I still want to talk with you (whether or not you are in my team makes no difference). I do try to have several 'skip-level' meetings a month. But, to help with this, I have created an open invitation in [Google Calendar](https://calendar.app.google/sc7MGydo7mU1QStz8) for you to book. These are my open office hours. Come with any topic in mind. 
* <b>Bi-weekly Team Lead Meetings:</b> These will include both Engineering Domain Managers and Team Leads. I include an agenda in the calendar invite. I will ask you to be prepared for discussions, and for any specific preparation I will make a direct request in the #team-analytics-leads slack channel. I expect you to come prepared and I need you to participate. I deliberately include the full Analytics department leadership to help with transparency and clarity in our dynamic field.
* <b>Your teams:</b>
   - Help me celebrate the small and big wins. Share details with me directly. We have a Monthly Analytics Caucus and a monthly newsletter. This is a great chance to shout-out and share these wins as well.
   - We have a very young team (early career) and in some cases, young leaders. Please don't hesitate to ask me for help with hard conversations or other leadership challenges you have. That is what I am here for.
   - When you have a new joiner, remind me and I would love to have a 1:1 with them to get to know them. 
   
## How I Communicate

### Ways to reach me (in priority order):

1. Slack
2. Text/WhatsApp (number is in slack)
3. Email

### Please reach out

Please always reach out to me on Slack. I would rather you send me a ping than not. I prefer more communication than less. And it is not a bother. Use my office hours for more verbal discussions.

### How to communicate challenges

If you have a problem, bring it. But come with ideas about solutions or information that will help me to help you decide something.

### Feedback

Feedback is important. Please give it, especially constructive and not anonymous. I will not be mad or upset with you, nor will I retaliate or seek retribution. I take all feedback to heart and will typically think on it for a while and try to correct or take relevant action.
