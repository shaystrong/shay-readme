## 💼 Management & Leadership Style

- 🧍‍♀️ **Authenticity matters**  
  I show up the same way at work as I do outside of it.

- 🔄 **Feedback is foundational**  
  I value it deeply, even if it doesn't come naturally. I expect my leadership team to practice and grow in giving/receiving feedback too.

- 📊 **I am a scientist**  
  Be direct. Be precise. Bring facts. I avoid vague, qualitative language—especially around engineering decisions.

- 🤔 **I process before I speak**  
  I might not have an immediate answer. I will follow up once I’ve thought it through.

- 📈 **“Data or death”**  
  I act on data. If you want to influence decisions, bring numbers, hypotheses, or scenarios—not just opinions.

- 🧑‍💻 **Decisions ≠ black boxes**  
  I seek alignment, but I won’t stall. If you don’t weigh in, I’ll move forward with what I know.

- ⚡ **I embrace fast, creative change**  
  I move fast when it matters (see: relocating family to Finland mid-pandemic). Always with intent.

- 🌱 **Culture isn’t mine to uphold alone**  
  You were hired to lead it with me. Be transparent, intentional, data-driven, and inclusive.

- 🤝 **I trust you**  
  Bring challenges early. Avoid surprise escalations we could have addressed proactively.

- 🔁 **Follow through matters**  
  I don’t like chasing people for things. Proactive ownership builds trust.

- 💋 **Vulnerability wins**  
  I’ll admit what I don’t know. Please do the same.

- ⏱️ **Time is respect**  
  Chronic lateness sends a message. Let me know if you’ll be late. I’ll do the same.

- ❤️ **I care about you**  
  Your hobbies, family, and passions outside work matter to me.

- 👨‍👧 **Family first**  
  Jobs are temporary. Life isn’t. Don’t miss what matters most.

## 🗣️ Communication Style

| Channel         | Priority   | Notes                                   |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Slack           | 🔝 Top     | Always start here                       |
| Text/WhatsApp   | ✅ Urgent  | Number in Slack                         |
| Email           | ☑️ OK     | For non-urgent or async threads         |

### 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Acknowledge Slack pings—even an emoji helps
- 🧵 Start with a TL;DR or clear intent
- 🖼️ Use visuals, sketches, or whiteboards when possible
- 🚫 Avoid long monologues or walls of text
- 📢 Over-communicate progress and blockers
- ✍️ If I comment in docs/slides, assume edits—not personal replies

---

## ⚠️ When Things Get Hard

- 🛠 **Bring problems**—with ideas or data if possible
- 🧜‍♀️ **Feedback is welcome**—I don’t retaliate, I reflect and adjust
- ❓ **You’re not expected to know everything**—ask early and often

---

## 📊 What I Expect From You

> I will assume you are capable, motivated, and empowered to lead your work. I don’t micromanage—I trust you.

But that trust comes with two expectations:

### 1. 🔄 Drive with Proactivity
- You own your space. I expect you to lead, not wait for tasks.
- Bring initiative. Spot problems early, propose paths forward, and take the first swing.
- Keep momentum. Don’t get stuck in “waiting mode.”

### 2. 🚫 Communicate When You’re Stuck
- Independence does **not** mean isolation. I don’t want people suffering silently.
- If something is unclear, broken, or blocked—**say so early**. Don’t burn time spinning wheels.
- It’s not weakness to raise a flag. It’s leadership. And it builds trust.

> We don’t have time to waste. Silence = perceived progress. If I don’t hear from you, I’ll assume it’s handled. If it’s not, I need you to tell me—early and clearly.
